# Risk Analysis

## Introduction

Risk Analysis
In this project, we will conduct risk analysis on four of the tech giants, Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft. 
We will extract the past 5 years of data from Yahoo finance, visualize the trend, look at the correlations among each other. 
Finally, we will calculate Value at Risk(VaR) through bootstrap method and Monte Carlo simulation with Geometric Brownian Motion(GBM).
